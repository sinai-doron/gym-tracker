# Makes Gym Tracker's Play upload key, once, and keeps it in exactly two places: two secrets in GCP
# Secret Manager (the key file and its password), and the owner's Strongbox database (an entry with
# the password and the file attached, done by hand while this script waits). No copy stays on disk.
#
# The password is typed at a prompt and passed to keytool and gcloud through the environment and a
# pipe, never as an argument, so it is in neither the shell history nor the process list.
#
# Run it in a terminal (it asks questions):  scripts/make-upload-key.sh
# Needs: keytool (from a JDK), gcloud signed in as someone allowed to create secrets in the project.

Now the second copy, in Strongbox:
  1. Add an entry titled "Gym Tracker – Play upload key".
  2. Put the password you just typed in its Password field.
  3. Attach this file to it: $key
     (Finder: Go → Go to Folder…, paste the folder; or drag it from: open "$work")
  4. Save the database.
